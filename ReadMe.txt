In this Core project, i take advantage of N-Tier architecture pattern so layers of architecture are Kernel, DataAccess, MAP, Entity, Business, Associate, Web also Web layer has MVC  Pattern I used Repository Pattern, Unit of Work Pattern, User Identity to management User Roles and authentication. Also   users can login by Google Authentication. I Used AutoMapper and Value Injecter to match Entities and DTOs'. I buid private live chat system among users by Microsoft SignalR.I Used Fluent Validation package for Entities validation. I Used IoC Container for Dependency Injection so if I want I can use my Abtstract classes in another projects.Also I often took advantage of JavaScript.
